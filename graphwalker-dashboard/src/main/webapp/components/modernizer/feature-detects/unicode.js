/**
 * Unicode special character support
 * 
 * Detection is made by testing missing glyph box rendering against star character
 * If widths are the same, this "probably" means the browser didn't support the star character and rendered a glyph box instead
 * Just need to ensure the font characters have different widths
 * 
 * Warning : positive Unicode support doesn't mean you can use it inside <title>, this seams more related to OS & Language packs
