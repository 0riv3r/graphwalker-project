// GamePad API
// https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html
// By Eric Bidelman

// FF has Gamepad API support only in special builds, but not in any release (even behind a flag)
// Their current implementation has no way to feature detect, only events to bind to.
//   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/#toc-featuredetect

// but a patch will bring them up to date with the spec when it lands (and they'll pass this test)
//   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690935

Modernizr.addTest('gamepads', !!Modernizr.prefixed('getGamepads', navigator));
