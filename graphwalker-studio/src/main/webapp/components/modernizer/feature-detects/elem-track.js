// Track element + Timed Text Track API

// While IE10 has implemented the track element, IE10 does not expose the underlying APIs to create timed text tracks by JS (really sad)
// By Addy Osmani
Modernizr.addTest({
	texttrackapi: (typeof (document.createElement('video').addTextTrack) === 'function'),
	// a more strict test for track including UI support: document.createElement('track').kind === 'subtitles'
	track: ('kind' in document.createElement('track'))
